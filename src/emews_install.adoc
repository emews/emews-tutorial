== Installing EMEWS

EMEWS supports two installation modes, Binary and Source, described in the following subsections:

=== Binary

Binary installations are recommended for this tutorial and small scale testing on supported systems.
The binary installation is implemented as a conda environment that contains all the necessary EMEWS
components including Swift/T, R, Python, Postgresql, and the R and Python packages. 

The binary install is a conda environment, and requires a conda installation as a prerequisite. Please install https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/[miniforge],
https://www.anaconda.com/download[anaconda], or https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install[miniconda] if
you do not have an existing conda installation. For the differences between the three with respect to Anaconda's Terms of Service and remaining in compliance with those terms, see https://www.anaconda.com/blog/is-conda-free[is conda free]. More information on conda enviroments can found https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html[here].

See <<_quickstart>> for how to download the install scripts and install the environment with the `install_emews.sh` script. The remainder
of this section will walk through the relevant parts of the script in greater detail. 

==== The Install Script

After performing some initial error checking and variable definition, the install script performs the
install steps, beginning with creating the conda environment.

[source, bash]
----
ENV_NAME=emews-py${PY_VERSION}    <1>
TEXT="Creating conda environment '${ENV_NAME}' using Python ${PY_VERSION}"  <2>
start_step "$TEXT"  <3>
# echo "Creating conda environment '${ENV_NAME}' using ${PY_VERSION}"
conda create -y -n $ENV_NAME python=${PY_VERSION} > "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG" 2>&1 || on_error "$TEXT" "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG"  <4>
end_step "$TEXT"  <5>
----
<1> Format the name of the environment using the python version passed
on the command line.
<2> Format the text used in the script output for this step in the script execution
<3> Display the formatted step text with an unchecked text box.
<4> Create the named conda environment redirecting the output to the install log, and 
terminating the script on error.
<5> Display the formatted step text with a checked text box indicating that this step
has completed.

The next step in the script is to the `swift-t-r` conda package which installs Swift/T and
all its dependencies including a custom R installation. The step text formatting
and display works the same as above, and so is not explained further.

[source, bash]
----
TEXT="Installing swift-t conda package"
start_step "$TEXT"
source $CONDA_BIN_DIR/activate $ENV_NAME  <1>
conda install -y -c conda-forge -c swift-t swift-t-r >> "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG" 2>&1 || on_error "$TEXT" "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG"  <2>
conda deactivate  <3>
source $CONDA_BIN_DIR/activate $ENV_NAME  <4>
end_step "$TEXT"
----
<1> Activate the conda environment created in the first step, in order to install
the packages into it.
<2> Install the `swift-t-r` conda package.
<3> Deactivate the environment.
<4> Activate the environment again to trigger any environment activation scripts installed
by the `swift-t-r` package.

The next step installs the PostgreSQL database software from a conda package.

[source, bash]
----
TEXT="Installing PostgreSQL"
start_step "$TEXT"
conda install -y -c conda-forge postgresql >> "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG" 2>&1 || on_error "$TEXT" "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG"
end_step "$TEXT"
----

The EMEWS Creator Python package is then installed. This also installs the 
eqsql Python package as a dependency.

[source, bash]
----
TEXT="Installing EMEWS Creator"
start_step "$TEXT"
pip install emewscreator >> "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG" 2>&1 || on_error "$TEXT" "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG"
end_step "$TEXT"
----

EMEWS Creator is then used to initialize the EMEWS DB database in the
database directory location (i.e., `$2`) that was passed in the command line.
See <<_init_db>> for more information for more details about the database installation,
and <<creating_emews_projects>> for more on EMEWS Creator.

[source, bash]
----
TEXT="Initializing EMEWS Database"
emewscreator init_db -d $2 >> "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG" 2>&1 || on_error "$TEXT" "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG"
end_step "$TEXT"
----

Lastly, the install script installs the R packages required when using EMEWS DB with R.

[source, bash]
----
TEXT="Initializing Required R Packages"
Rscript $THIS/install_pkgs.R >> "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG" 2>&1 || on_error "$TEXT" "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG"  <1>
Rscript -e "remotes::install_github('emews/EQ-SQL/R/EQ.SQL')" >> "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG" 2>&1 || on_error "$TEXT" "$EMEWS_INSTALL_LOG"  <2>
end_step "$TEXT"
----
<1> Use the R installed as part of the `swift-t-r` package to execute the `install_pkgs.R` script. This
script installs the required R packages from the CRAN repository, and tests that they can be loaded successfully.
<2> Install the EMEWS DB EQ.SQL R package from github.


=== Source

==== Motivation

It is generally easiest and most reliable to install packages from your system package manager such as Homebrew, APT, or RPM.  On some systems (such as compute clusters and supercomputers), however, you must build from source to access the site-specific MPI implementation used for communication inside the Swift/T workflow.  You may also desire to use specific versions of Python or R to support your applications.  Thus, it is possible to mix and match the EMEWS installation with binary and source installations of its dependencies.

==== List of supported platforms

Source installations are supported for:

* Linux on x86 (`linux-64`)
* Linux on ARM64 (`linux-aarch64`)
* macOS on x86 (`osx-64`)
* macOS on ARM64 (`osx-arm64`)
* Windows WSL

==== Source installation procedure

The source installation procedure is a more manual way to perform the same operations that are found in the `install_emews.sh` script.

To build from source, you will need the following packages (with their APT names):
SWIG (+swig+), ZSH (+zsh+), Apache Ant (+ant+),
a Java Development Kit (+default-jdk+) >= 1.6, Make (+make+),
GCC for C (+gcc+), Python (+python3-dev+), R (+r-base-dev+), Tcl (+tcl-dev+),
and an MPI implementation (e.g., +mpich+).

EMEWS supports any compiler toolset and MPI implementation.  It is important to maintain consistency with the C compiler across all the tools linked together under Swift/T, which is automatically done under a package manager.  If you install some of these tools from the package manager, and manually compile some with the compiler under the same package manager, you will be fine.

A complete description of the Swift/T installation may be found at the https://swift-lang.github.io/swift-t/guide.html#_installation[Swift/T Guide].

You must also install Postgres, but this does not have to be linked to Swift/T.  The instructions for this are under the https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/admin.html[Postgres Server Administration Docs].

Then install EMEWS Creator with:

----
$ pip install emewscreator
----

Then, install necessary R libraries with:

----
$ Rscript code/install/install_pkgs.R
----

or build them manually.

When you run EMEWS Creator, you will need to refer to the tools installed here (R and Tcl) during EQ/R build process.
