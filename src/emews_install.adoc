For Linux or macOS on x86, simply install Anaconda package `swift-t-r`:
----
$ conda install -c conda-forge -c swift-t swift-t-r
----

See https://anaconda.org/swift-t/swift-t-r[the Anaconda.org site] for the full list of versions.

=== Source

Source installations are supported for:

* Linux on x86 (`linux-64`)
* Linux on ARM64
* macOS on x86 (`osx-64`)
* macOS on ARM64 (`osx-arm64`)

To install from source, you need to install R and then Swift/T.
You may install R using your system package manager or a from-source build.

A complete description of the Swift/T installation may be found at the https://swift-lang.github.io/swift-t/guide.html#_installation[Swift/T Guide].
