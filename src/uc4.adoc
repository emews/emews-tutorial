[[uc4, Use Case 4 Tutorial - An EQSQL Workflow]]
== Minimizing the Ackley function with an EQSQL Workflow

Our 4th use case workflow implements an example EQSQL optimization workflow
that attempts to find the minimum of the Ackley function using a 
Gaussian process regression model (GPR). Our implementation,
is based on a similar example problem provided as part of the Colmena https://github.com/exalearn/colmena/blob/bd334e0a582fb79d97652d67d05666f13d178f83/demo_apps/optimizer-examples/streaming.py#L1[documentation,window=colmena,pts="noopener,nofollow"].
We begin with a sample set containing a number of randomly generated n-dimensional points. 
Each of these points is submitted as a task to the Ackley function for evaluation. When
a specified number of tasks have completed (i.e., that number of Ackley function evaluation results
are available), we train a GPR using the results, and 
reorder the evaluation of the remaining tasks, increasing the priority of those more
likely to find an optimal result according to the GPR. This repeats until all the evaluations complete.

This tutorial uses the project structure and files created from the
emews creator <<eqsql_top,eqsql>> template, and that should be read before this.

=== Tutorial Goals

* Run an EQSQL Workflow in Swift/T
* Implement a Python ME that produces tasks (parameters) for parallel evaluation
* Implement the parallel evalution of those tasks in a SWift/T worker pool

=== Running the Workflow

The workflow is designed to be run with a local swift-t conda install:

#TODO: proper install instructions#

* install conda
* create swift-t env
* install swift-t conda package
* pip3 install -e EQ/SQL
* pip3 install emews_creator
* conda install postgres, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn
* emewscreator init_db


The workflow can be run using the https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/python/me.py#L1[`uc4/python/me.py`,window=me,pts="noopener,nofollow"] python script. It takes two arguments:

1. An experiment id, e.g. "test_ackley".
2. The path to the ME configuration file, i.e., `uc4/python/me_cfg.yaml`

For example,

[source, bash]
----
$ cd uc4/python
$ python3 me.py test_ackley me_cfg.yaml
----

Running the workflow will create an experiment directory whose name 
consists of th experiment id followed by a timestamp. The workflow runs 
within this directory.

=== Workflow Project Structure
The full source code for this use case can be accessed https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/tree/main/uc4[here,window=uc4,pts="noopener,nofollow"].
The completed workflow project has the following directory structure and files:
// NB: Generated using tree.

The initial version of this project was created using EMEWS Creator with the following command:
[source#uc4-creator,bash]
----
emewscreator -o uc4 eqsql -c tutorial_cfgs/UC4.yaml
----

See the eqsql <<eqsql_top, section>> in the emews creator documentation for additional information on the general project structure.

As an eqsql project, the ME algorithm in the UC4 example submits tasks to a database. Those tasks are retrieved
and executed by a worker pool, which then submits the results back where they can be used by the ME. Here, the ME produces inputs to the Ackley function submitting those as tasks to the database. The
worker pool evaluates those inputs in parallel by executing the Ackley function on them, and pushes the results back to the database. Periodically, the ME uses a GPR model to re-prioritize the unevaluated
remaining inputs, assigning a higher priority to those it deems more likely to produce a minimum. The following files implement this workflow.

* `python/me.py` - the Python ME that submits the Ackley inputs and re-prioritizes them
* `python/me_cfg.yaml` - the configuration file for the ME
* `swift/ackley_worker_pool.swift` - the worker pool that retrieves the inputs for evaluation by the Ackley function
* `swift/run_ackley_worker_pool.sh` - a bash script used to launch the worker pool
* `swift/cfgs/ackley_worker_pool.cfg` - the configuration file for the worker pool
* `scripts/run_ackley.sh` - a bash script called by the worker pool to run the Python Ackley function
* `python/ackley.py` - the Ackley function implemented in Python and called by the `run_ackley.sh` bash script

=== The Ackley Function

The http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/ackley.html[Ackley,window=ackley_doc,pts="noopener,nofollow"] function is widely used for testing optimization algorithms.
In our example project, it is implemented in https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/python/ackley.py#L1[`uc4/python/ackley.py`,window=ackley_py,pts="noopener,nofollow"] 

[NOTE]
====
We have added a lognormally distributed sleep delay to the Ackley function implementation to increase the otherwise millisecond runtime and to add task runtime heterogeneity for demonstration purposes.
====

=== Calling the Ackley Function from Swift

The Ackley function is implemented in Python and is called by the swift worker pool 
using a bash script https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/scripts/run_ackley.sh#L1[`uc4/scripts/run_ackley.sh`,window=run_ackley,pts="noopener,nofollow"] 


The `run_ackley.sh` script takes 5 inputs, which are passed from the worker pool swift code when
the script is called. 

[source, bash]
----
 Set PARAM_LINE from the first argument to this script
# PARAM_LINE is the string containing the model parameters for a run.
PARAM_LINE=$1

# Set the name of the file to write model output to.
OUTPUT_FILE=$2

# Set the TRIAL_ID - this can be used to pass a random seed (for example)
# to the model
TRIAL_ID=$3

# Set EMEWS_ROOT to the root directory of the project (i.e. the directory
# that contains the scripts, swift, etc. directories and files)
EMEWS_ROOT=$4

# Each model run, runs in its own "instance" directory
# Set INSTANCE_DIRECTORY to that.
INSTANCE_DIRECTORY=$5
----

[NOTE]
====
The `TRIAL_ID` is not used when running the Ackley function
====

After cd-ing to the `INSTANCE_DIRECTORY`, the script runs the Ackley function Python code using these inputs. 

[source, bash]
----
cd $INSTANCE_DIRECTORY

# TODO: Define the command to run the model.
MODEL_CMD="$HOME/anaconda3/envs/swift-t-r-py3.9/bin/python3"    <1>
# TODO: Define the arguments to the MODEL_CMD. Each argument should be
# surrounded by quotes and separated by spaces.
arg_array=( "$EMEWS_ROOT/python/ackley.py"    <2>
            "$PARAM_LINE"
            "$OUTPUT_FILE")

$TIMEOUT_CMD "$MODEL_CMD" "${arg_array[@]}"    <3>
----
<1> Set the Python interpreter to use for running the Ackley Python code.
<2> Set the Ackley python implementation file, the input parameters, and
the file to write the Ackley function output to as arguments to the Python command.
<3> Execute the Python command with the provided arguments. 


[NOTE]
====
The `$TIMEOUT_CMD`
is an optional argument that can be set at the top of the bash script to
provide a duration after which the command called by the bash script times out.
By default it is an empty string and has no effect.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
We typically use JSON formatted strings to describe model input parameters. The
ME will push JSON formatted dictionaries to the database, and those strings
are retrieved by the worker pool, passed to the bash script, and from there
to the model execution itself.
====

When the `run_ackley.sh` scripts calls `python/ackley.py` to execute the
Ackley function on the provided input, the https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/python/ackley.py#L50[`__main__`,window=ackley_main,pts="noopener,nofollow"] section of `ackley.py` is executed. The `__main__` section receives the Ackley function input (the `$PARAM_LINE` variable in 
`run_ackley.sh`), and the path to the output file as command line arguments. It unpacks
these arguments, calls the `run` function, and writes the result to the output file.

[source, python]
----
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # param_line, output_file
    param_str = sys.argv[1]    <1>
    output_file = sys.argv[2]

    y = run(param_str)    <2>
    with open(output_file, 'w') as fout:    <3>
        fout.write(f'{y}')
----
<1> Unpack the command line arguments.
<2> Call the run function, passing the Ackley function input.
<3> Write the Ackley function result to the output file.

`run` unpacks the Ackley function parameters and calls the Ackley function itself.

[source, python]
----
def run(param_str: str) -> str:
    """Run the Ackley function on the specified JSON
    payload.
    """
    args = json.loads(param_str)    <1>
    x = np.array(args['x'])    <2>

    result = ackley(x)    <3>
    return json.dumps(result)     <4>
----
<1> Load the parameter string in to a dictionary. The parameter string
is formatted as a JSON map where each entry in the map is an input variable.
<2> Convert the parameter `x` entry into a numpy array. `x` is a JSON list in the
parameter string and needs to be converted to an array for the Ackley function.
<3> Run the Ackley function.
<4> Return the Ackley function result as a JSON string.


The swift worker pool script is largely unchanged from what is created by the
eqsql emews creator template which is described <<swift_worker_pool, here>>. We have, 
however, edited the `get_result` function to return the result of an
Ackley evaluation.

[source, swift]
----
(float result) get_result(string output_file) {
    // Read the output file to get result
    file of = input(output_file);    <1>
    result = string2float(read(of));    <2>
}
----
<1> Initialize the output file as a swift-t file object. `output_file` is the path
passed to `ackley.py` as a command line argument. The Ackley function result is
written to this file in https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/python/ackley.py#L56[`python/ackley.py`,
window=ackley_write_result,pts="noopener,nofollow"]
<2> Read the first line of that file, which contains the result, and convert the
string to a float.

The worker pool configuration file (https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/swift/cfgs/ackley_worker_pool.cfg#L1[`swift/cfgs/ackley_worker_pool.cfg`,window=ackley_worker_pool_cfg,pts="noopener,nofollow"]) and the worker pool launch script
(https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/swift/run_ackley_worker_pool.sh#L1[`swift/run_ackley_worker_pool.sh`,window=run_ackley_worker_pool_sh,pts="noopener,nofollow"])
are unchanged from those produced by eqsql template. A discussion of them can be found <<pool_cfg,here>>
and <<eqsql_launch_script,here>>

==== Alternatives to a Bash Script

Python and R code can also be executed directly using Swift-T's embedded Python and R interpreters. When calling Python or R
code directly from Swift, the convention is to provide the code to call in a text string with template arguments for the
variables that will be passed to the Python and R code. For example, calling the Ackley function Python code from within
Swift might look like:

[source, swift]
----
string ackley_code_template =    <1>
"""
import ackley

param_str = '%s'    <2>
result = ackley.run(param_str)    <3>
"""
----
<1> Embed the Python code to be called in a string
<2> Use a formatting token for the parameters to pass to the Ackley function
<3> Call the Ackley function code, putting the result in the `result`` variable

To run the code in this string, it is first formatted then executed by the
embedded interpreter.

[source, swift]
----
string code = ackley_code_template % (task_payload);    <1>
string result = python_persist(code, "result");    <2>
----
<1> Replace the `%s`` in the `ackley_code_template` string with the task payload
<2> Execute resulting string (i.e., `code`) in the Python interpreter, returning the value of the
named `result` variable.

See http://swift-lang.github.io/swift-t/guide.html#external_scripting[Swift-T External Scripting,window=swift_e_s,pts="noopener,nofollow"] for more details on using the embedded Python and R interpreters.

The primary advantage of using the embedded interpreters are being able retrieve the results without
writing to a file and then reading that file, and so streamlining the code and avoiding file I/O. The
disadvantage is that only the interpreters that are compiled into SWift can be used. HPC resources
often provide a variety of Pythons for different tasks and hardware. When running from a bash script,
the script can select the most appropriate Python (or R) for the task, rather than being constrained to a single
one. 

NOTE: In addition to running a model, the embeded Python interpreter can be very useful for manipulating parameter strings removing, adding or transforming parameters.

=== The Ackley ME

The Ackley workflow can be run by executing the Python script https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/python/me.py#L1[`python/me.py`,window=me_py,pts="noopener,nofollow"]
The code begins by
starting the EQ/SQL database, the worker pool, and initializing a task queue through which tasks can be sent to the worker pool via the database. The code then submits a user specified amount of initial tasks to the database, and waits
for a prespecified number of tasks to complete. When that number has completed, the remaining unexecuted tasks are reprioritized 
using a GPR model. This continues until some total number have been completed. The intention is to illustrate a typical
ME workflow where tasks are submitted to a task queue, and the ME waits for some to complete, at which point it can submit new tasks based on the existing results and reprioritize unexecuted tasks if necessary.

The code consists of a Python `dataclass` for encapsulating a task, 5 functions, and a `__main__` block. The `create_parser`, and
`__main__` block are discussed in the emews creator eqsql <<me_main,section>> and won't be discussed here. 
Similarily, creating the task queue, and starting the database, and worker pool which are performed in the `run` function were also discussed
in the  emews creator eqsql <<me_init,section>> and will not be covered here. 

After initialization, the `run` function calls hhttps://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/python/me.py#L23[`submit_initial_tasks`,window=submit_initial_tasks,pts="noopener,nofollow"], passing it the created task_queue,
the user provided experiment id, and the ME input parameters as a dictionary. The random samples 
used as Ackley function input data are created and submitted as tasks for evaluation.

[source, python]
----
def submit_initial_tasks(task_queue, exp_id: str, params: Dict) -> Dict[int, Task]:
    ...
    search_space_size = params['search_space_size']    <1>
    dim = params['sample_dimensions']    <2>
    sampled_space = np.random.uniform(size=(search_space_size, dim),    <3>
                                      low=-32.768, high=32.768)

    task_type = params['task_type']    <4>

    payloads = []
    for sample in sampled_space:    <5>
        payload = json.dumps({'x': list(sample)})   
        payloads.append(payload)
    _, fts = task_queue.submit_tasks(exp_id, eq_type=task_type, payload=payloads)    <6>

    tasks = {ft.eq_task_id: Task(future=ft, sample=sampled_space[i], result=None)    <7>
             for i, ft in enumerate(fts)}

    return tasks
----
<1> Get the search space size, i.e., the number of initial samples to evaluate.
<2> Get the number of dimensions in each sample.
<3> Create a numpy 2D array of `search_space_size` where each row is an array of `dim` size
containing random numbers between -32.768 and 32.768.
<4> Get the task type id to be used in task submission. A worker pool will query for
tasks of a specific type, and this identifies that type.
<5> For each sample in the sampled space, create a JSON map with a single key, `x`,
whose value is the sample array. Add that JSON string to a list of payloads
to submit to the database queue.
<6> Submit the list of payloads as tasks to be executed, passing the experiment id, and
task type. The submission returns a status, which we assume to be successful and ignore,
and a list of `eqsql.eq.Future` objects.
<7> Create and return a Python dictionary of Task dataclass objects. Each Task contains
the `Future` for that tasks, the numpy array that was submitted as that task's input,
and a result (which is initially None, indicating that the task has not yet been evaluated).

[NOTE]
====
Numpy structures such as arrays are not directly JSON-ifiable, and so
we need to convert them into Python structures that are, such as lists.
====

Having submitted the initial tasks, `run` begins the optimization https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/python/me.py#L124[loop,
window=opt_loop,pts="noopener,nofollow"]. The loop repeatedly queries for
some number of completed tasks using a task queues' `as_completed` method which returns
an iterator over that number of completed tasks, waiting for tasks to complete if necessary.
When `as_completed` finishes returning completed tasks, we reprioritize the remaining
uncompleted tasks using the results provided by the completed tasks. The loop continues
calling `as_completed` and reprioritizing until the total number of tasks have completed.

[source, python]
----
tasks = submit_initial_tasks(task_queue, exp_id, params)
total_completed = params['total_completed']    <1>
tasks_completed = 0
reprioritize_after = params['reprioritize_after']    <2>
# list of futures for the submitted tasks
fts = [t.future for t in tasks.values()]    <3>

while tasks_completed < total_completed:    <4>
    # add the result to the completed Tasks.
    for ft in task_queue.as_completed(fts, pop=True, n=reprioritize_after):    <5>
        _, result = ft.result()    <6>
        tasks[ft.eq_task_id].result = json.loads(result)    <7>
        tasks_completed += 1    <8>

    reprioritize(tasks)    <9>
----
<1> Get the total number of tasks to complete (i.e., the total number of Ackley function evaluations
to perform) before stopping.
<2> Get the number of tasks to complete before reprioritizing.
<3> Create a list containing all the Task futures. Most of the eqsql functions that
return some number of completed tasks, or tasks as they complete, use a list of Futures
as an argument, so we create that here.
<4> While the number of completed tasks is less than the total number to complete,
wait for another `reprioritize_after` number of tasks to complete, and then reprioritize.
<5> Iterate through `reprioritize_after` number of completed Futures. Those futures 
are popped off the `fts` list of futures. 
<6> Get the result of a completed Future.
<7> JSON-ify that result and set the result attribute of the Task associated with that
Future. 
<8> Increment the number of total completed tasks.
<9> After another `reprioritize_after` number of tasks have completed, and their results
assigned to the corresponding Task object, reprioritize the uncompleted tasks.

The https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/python/me.py#L66[`reprioritize`,window=reprioritize,pts="noopener,nofollow"] function uses the completed task results
captured in the `result` attribute of the Tasks objects to reprioritize the remaining tasks. It begins by separating
the Task objects into training and prediction data sets.

[source, python]
----
def reprioritize(tasks: Dict[int, Task]):
    training = []
    uncompleted_fts = []
    prediction = []
    for t in tasks.values():    <1>
        if t.result is None:    <2>
            uncompleted_fts.append(t.future)
            prediction.append(t.sample)
        else:
            training.append([t.sample, t.result])    <3>
----
<1> Iterate through all the Tasks, separating them into
test and prediction data sets.
<2> If the Task's result is None (i.e., it hasn't completed) then
add its sample input to the prediction data set, and it's future to the list
of uncompleted futures.
<3> Add the completed Task's sample input and result values to the training data.

With the training and prediction data created, `reprioritize` fits the GPR
using the training data and ranks the uncompleted tasks by likelihood
of minimizing the Ackley function. Using that ranking, it then reprioritizes the remaining 
uncompleted tasks.

[source, python]
----
fts = []
priorities = []
max_priority = len(uncompleted_fts)    <1>
ranking = fit_gpr(training, prediction)    <2>
for i, idx in enumerate(ranking):    <3>
    ft = uncompleted_fts[idx]
    priority = max_priority - i    <4>
    fts.append(ft)
    priorities.append(priority)

print("Reprioritizing ...", flush=True)
eq.update_priority(fts, priorities)     <5>
----
<1> Set the maximum priority to the number of uncompleted tasks.
<2> Call the GPR to get the Task ranking. The returned ranking
is a ranked list of indices into the prediction data.
<3> For each index in the ranking, get the Future corresponding
to that index, assign a priority, and add the Future and the
priority to their respective lists.
<4> Compute a priority by subtracting the current iteration index
from the max priority.
<5> Update the priorities of the specified futures to the priorities
in the specified list.

The ME itself is configured using a yaml format configuration file,
https://github.com/emews/emews-tutorial-code/blob/main/uc4/python/me_cfg.yaml#L1[`python/me_cfg.yaml`, window=me_cfg,pts="noopener,nofollow"]. The ME
code reads in this file, and creates a `params` Python dictionary from it. In addition to 
those entries described in the emews creator eqsql template <<algo_cfg,section>>, the file contains
the following entries:

[source, yaml]
----
search_space_size: 50    <1>
sample_dimensions: 4    <2>
total_completed: 40    <3>
reprioritize_after: 10    <4>
----
<1> The size of the sample search space. This many samples are created and submitted as 
tasks for Ackley function evaluation by the worker pool.
<2> The number of dimensions in each sample.
<3> The total number of Ackley function evaluations to complete before stopping.
<4> The number of tasks to complete before reprioritizing. Each time this number of additional Ackley function
evaluations have completed, reprioritize the remaining uncompleted tasks.
