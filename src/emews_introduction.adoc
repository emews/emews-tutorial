== EMEWS Introduction and Quickstart

=== Extreme-scale Model Exploration with Swift (EMEWS)

Modern computational studies, involving simulation, AI/ML, or other black-box models, are campaigns consisting of large numbers of these models with many possible variations. The models may be run with different parameters, possibly as part of an automated model parameter optimization, classification, or, more generally, *model exploration (ME)*. Constructing the software to run
such studies at the requisite computational scales is often unnecessarily time-consuming and the resulting
software artifacts are typically difficult to generalize and
package for other users.

In this tutorial, we present a solution for many of the challenges in running large-scale ME studies.  Our framework, Extreme-scale Model Exploration with Swift (*EMEWS*) cite:[ozik_desktop_2016], provides ready-to-use workflows developed in the general-purpose parallel scripting language Swift/T cite:[wozniak_swiftt_2013].  These workflows are designed so that most of the interesting control logic is performed in the mathematically-oriented ME.  The general-purpose nature of the programming model also allows the user to supplement the workflows with additional analyses and post-processing.  The <<swift_usage,Appendix: Using Swift/T>> is provided for cases in which customized use of Swift/T is required.

Our focus is on computational models that require the use of approximate, heuristic ME methods involving large ensembles. To improve the current state of the art it has been noted elsewhere that: “...
there is a clear need to provide software frameworks for
metaheuristics that promote software reuse and reduce developmental
effort” cite:[boussaid_survey_2013]. Our design goals are to ease
software integration while providing scalability to the largest scale
(exascale plus) supercomputers, running millions of models, thousands
at a time. EMEWS has shown robust scalability cite:[ozik_population_2021,wozniak_candle_supervisor_2018]. The tools are also easy to install and run on an ordinary
laptop, requiring only an MPI (Message Passing Interface) implementation, which can be easily
obtained from common OS package repositories.

==== EMEWS workflow structure

This figure illustrates the main components of the EMEWS framework.  The main user interface is the Swift script, a high-level
program.  The core novel contributions of
EMEWS are shown in green, these allow the Swift script to access a
running ME algorithm.

The ME algorithm can be expressed in Python, R, C, C++,
Fortran, Julia, Tcl, or any language supported by Swift/T.  We provide
a high-level queue-like interface with (currently) three
implementations: EQ/Py, EQ/R, and EQSQL (EMEWS Queues for
Python, R, and SQL). The interface defines the two functions `OUT_put` and `IN_get` for sending candidate model parameters from the ME algorithm to the Swift script and getting model outputs back, respectively. The interface also allows the Swift script to obtain
candidate model parameter inputs (`EQX_get`) and return model outputs to the ME (`EQX_put`).  The models are distributed over large and distributed computer system, but smaller systems that run one
model at a time are also supported.  The models can be
implemented as external applications called through the shell, built-in interpreters, or
in-memory libraries accessed directly by Swift (for faster
invocation).

EMEWS thus offers the following contributions to the science and
practice of computational ME studies: 

* It offers the capability to run very large, complex, and highly concurrent
  ensembles of models of varying types on a broad range of individual or distributed computing resources;
* It supports a wide class of model exploration algorithms,
  including those increasingly available to the community via Python and R libraries;
* It offers a software sustainability solution, in that computational workflows
 based around EMEWS can easily be compared and distributed.

==== Tutorial Goals

This tutorial aims to describe through examples the following main elements of the EMEWS framework:

* How external ME code can be incorporated with minimal modifications
* How the EMEWS Queues (EQ/Xs) are used to communicate between model exploration code and Swift workers
* How EMEWS enables the scaling of simulation and black box model exploration to large and distributed computing resources
* How modularized, multi-language code can be effectively tested and integrated within the EMEWS framework

=== Quickstart

The EMEWS installer will create a binary EMEWS environment (Swift/T, Python, R, and the EMEWS Python and R packages). 
The binary install is recommended for the tutorial and for small scale testing on non-HPC supported systems.

IMPORTANT: See <<_installing_emews>> for additional details about the install script,
and other kinds of installs, e.g., targeting HPC systems.


. *Install Conda*
+
The EMEWS binary install is a conda environment, and requires a conda installation as a prerequisite. Please install https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/[miniforge],
https://www.anaconda.com/download[anaconda], or https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install[miniconda] if
you do not have an existing conda installation. For the differences between the three with respect to Anaconda's Terms of Service and remaining in compliance with those terms, see https://www.anaconda.com/blog/is-conda-free[is conda free].
+
NOTE: For more information on conda enviroments see https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html[here]

. *Download the installer files*
+
[source, bash]
----
$ curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jozik/emews_next_gen_tutorial_tests/main/code/install/install_emews.sh
$ curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jozik/emews_next_gen_tutorial_tests/main/code/install/install_pkgs.R
----

. *Run the Installer*
+
[source, bash]
----
$ bash install_emews.sh install_emews.sh 3.11 ~/Documents/db/emews_db
----
+
This will install the EMEWS environment with Python 3.11 and create the EMEWS DB database in the 
`~/Documents/db/emews_db` directory. 
+
The install script, `install_emews.sh`, takes two arguments:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ bash install_emews.sh <python-version> <database-directory>
----
+
  .. The Python version to use - one of 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11
  .. The EMEWS DB database install directory - this must *NOT* already exist
+
The install will take a few minutes to download and install the necessary components,
reporting its progress as each step completes. A detailed log of the installation can be found
in `emews_install.log` in the same directory where the install script is run. The 
installer will create a conda environment named `emews-pyX.XX` where `X.XX` is the
Python version provide on the command line, i.e., 
`bash install_emews.sh install_emews.sh 3.11 ~/Documents/db/emews_db` creates a conda
environment named `emews-py3.11`. The environment can found in the `envs` directory
of your conda installation. 

IMPORTANT: If any errors occur during the install, refer to `emews_install.log` for
more details.

When the install finishes sucessfully, the output should end with the following:

[source,text]
----
# To activate this EMEWS environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate emews-pyX.XX
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
----

In order to use the EMEWS environment, it must be activated.
For example,

[source, bash]
----
$ conda activate emews-py3.11
----
