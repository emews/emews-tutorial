== EMEWS Introduction and Quickstart

=== Extreme-scale Model Exploration with Swift (EMEWS)

Modern computational studies, involving simulation, AI/ML, or other black-box models, are campaigns consisting of large numbers of these models with many possible variations. The models may be run with different parameters, possibly as part of an automated model parameter optimization, classification, or, more generally, *model exploration (ME)*. Constructing the software to run
such studies at the requisite computational scales is often unnecessarily time-consuming and the resulting
software artifacts are typically difficult to generalize and
package for other users.

In this tutorial, we present a solution for many of the challenges in
running large-scale ME studies.  Our framework, Extreme-scale Model
Exploration with Swift (*EMEWS*) cite:[ozik_desktop_2016], uses the general-purpose parallel
scripting language Swift/T cite:[wozniak_swiftt_2013] 
to generate highly
concurrent ME workflows.  These workflows enable the flexible integration of multi-language
ME algorithms and libraries to coordinate the running and evaluation of large numbers of models.  The general-purpose nature of
the programming model also allows the user to supplement the workflows with additional
analyses and post-processing.

Our focus is on computational models that require the use of approximate, heuristic ME methods involving large ensembles. To improve the current state of the art it has been noted elsewhere that: “...
there is a clear need to provide software frameworks for
metaheuristics that promote software reuse and reduce developmental
effort” cite:[boussaid_survey_2013]. Our design goals are to ease
software integration while providing scalability to the largest scale
(exascale plus) supercomputers, running millions of models, thousands
at a time. EMEWS has shown robust scalability cite:[ozik_population_2021,wozniak_candle_supervisor_2018]. The tools are also easy to install and run on an ordinary
laptop, requiring only an MPI (Message Passing Interface) implementation, which can be easily
obtained from common OS package repositories.

=== EMEWS workflow structure

This figure illustrates the main components of the EMEWS framework.  The main user interface is the Swift script, a high-level
program.  The core novel contributions of
EMEWS are shown in green, these allow the Swift script to access a
running ME algorithm.

The ME algorithm can be expressed in Python, R, C, C++,
Fortran, Julia, Tcl, or any language supported by Swift/T.  We provide
a high-level queue-like interface with (currently) three
implementations: EQ/Py, EQ/R, and EQSQL (EMEWS Queues for
Python, R, and SQL). The interface defines the two functions `OUT_put` and `IN_get` for sending candidate model parameters from the ME algorithm to the Swift script and getting model outputs back, respectively. The interface also allows the Swift script to obtain
candidate model parameter inputs (`EQX_get`) and return model outputs to the ME (`EQX_put`).  The models are distributed by the Swift/T runtime over a
potentially large computer system, but smaller systems that run one
model at a time are also supported.  The models can be
implemented as external applications called through the shell, built-in interpreters, or
in-memory libraries accessed directly by Swift (for faster
invocation).

EMEWS thus offers the following contributions to the science and
practice of computational ME studies: 

<ol id="myol">
<li> It offers the capability to run very large, highly concurrent
  ensembles of simulations of varying types;</li>
<li> It supports a wide class of model exploration algorithms,
  including those increasingly available to the community via Python and R libraries;</li>
<li> It offers a software sustainability solution, in that simulation
  studies based around <b id="myb">EMEWS</b> can easily be compared and
  distributed.</li>
