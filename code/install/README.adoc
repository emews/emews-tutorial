= EMEWS Installer

== Overview

This installer script installs EMEWS.  It does the following things:

. Install the workflow tools via `conda` and `pip`, including `swift-t-r` and thus `R` as a dependency
. Set up a database via `emewscreator`
. Install R packages via `install_R_pkgs.sh`

== Usage

Run

----
$ install_emews.sh -h
----

for help.

The packages will be installed in a Conda environment named `emews-py${PY_VERSION}` , where `PY_VERSION` is one of `"3.8" "3.9" "3.10" "3.11"`.

Use `conda activate` to activate the installed environment.
