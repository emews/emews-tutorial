The site is live at https://emews.org/emews-tutorial/

## Developer setup

### Ubuntu

Must install asciidoctor as APT package, then asciidoctor-bibtex as Ruby Gem.

Gem does not seem to work in Anaconda, Python 3.11, 2024-02-06 .

So do all these steps:

```
$ sudo apt install ruby-dev
$ sudo apt install asciidoctor
$ sudo gem install asciidoctor-bibtex
$ sudo gem install pygments.rb
```
